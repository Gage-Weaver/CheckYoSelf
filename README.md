# CheckYoSelf

## Inspiration
Gage is a sneaker reseller frequently forced to use apps like GOAT and StockX to sell items, as buyers are often concerned about authenticity. 
However, these services incur shipping and authentication fees.
To address this, we envisioned creating a peer-to-peer authentic items network that provides verification assistance and enables companies to issue authenticity guarantees through detailed item scans.

## What It Does
CheckYoSelf allows users to:
- Create accurate 3D scans of their items.
- View items as holograms or interactive, rotatable models.
- Enable future buyers or themselves to compare current items with previous scans, ensuring authenticity and preventing replacements.

## How We Built It
We developed CheckYoSelf using:
- iPhone's built-in scanning tools for generating detailed 3D models.
- Pinata for efficient file storage and rapid retrieval.
- Web and mobile technologies to display interactive holograms or rotatable object views.

## Challenges We Ran Into
- Associating scanned items securely and verifiably with individual users.
- Integrating and implementing smart contracts within our system.

## Accomplishments We're Proud Of
- Successfully integrating detailed item scanning.
- Delivering easily accessible and viewable holographic and rotating 3D models on both web and mobile platforms.

## What We Learned
This project provided significant insights, especially since neither of us had prior blockchain experience. Key takeaways include:
- Understanding blockchain basics and smart contract integration.
- Leveraging Pinata for streamlined file management.
- Effectively displaying 3D models across various platforms.

## Built With
- iPhone's 3D scanning tool (Object Capture)
- Pinata (File Storage & Retrieval)
- Blockchain Technology
- Smart Contracts
